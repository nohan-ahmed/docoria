## üìú Overview

The **Hospital Management Application** allows hospitals to list their services and provides patients with the ability to book appointments at their nearby hospitals. 
The system simplifies appointment management and aims to streamline hospital-patient interaction through a real-time notification system.

### Features (Planned)

- **Hospital Registration**: Hospitals can register and manage their profiles on the platform.
- **Patient Appointment Booking**: Patients can book appointments in nearby hospitals using a location-based search.
- **Real-time Notifications**: Hospitals and patients will receive real-time updates on booking status and confirmations.
- **Push Notifications**: Patients and hospitals will receive push notifications on important events such as appointment confirmation or changes.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login for both hospitals and patients.
- **Search Functionality**: Advanced search filters for finding the right hospital based on specialties, services, and location.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Backend

- **Language**: Python
- **Framework**: Django, Django Rest Framework (DRF)
- **Real-time Communication**: Django Channels & Redis for real-time notifications
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase
- **Database**: PostgreSQL

### Frontend (To Be Decided)

At this moment, the front-end technology is yet to be finalized. We are open to collaborating with developers who are proficient in:

- **React/Next.js**: If we find a collaborator with expertise in React or Next.js, we will go with this stack.
- **Vue/Nuxt.js**: If no React developers are available, we will proceed with Vue or Nuxt.js.

Feel free to get in touch if you're interested in contributing to the frontend!
